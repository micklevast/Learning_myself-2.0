###--------##file status  lifecycle --------##----in repo-------------####
1)untracked   2)unmodified   3)modified      4)staged


1)untracked ko traked karne ke liye =>$git init use ->then all file under these will become==>tracked
2)unmodified ko modified karne ke liye =>file me  kuchh changes karo =>so that some modification is happened

3)after modification =>changes ko repo me reflect karne liye  use
$git add --a    #so all changes will go under staged

then use another commond for to reflect these changes into our repo
$git commit -m"message"




git status
 git init  
 #->initilise the git repo for tracking
 #->these means a untracked repo
 ->by these there will a hidden ( .git) file will will created for to track our project

#do some change in your file -->then

1)staging  
#staginng means =>all file added under repo is unmodified
 git add --a  #means adding all file of these folder into the git repo
 git add text.txt #add only specified file name

2)commit
git commit -m"some message about these changes" =>so these file came under modified file

3)git status #->for user to see the currect working of git-status

4)git log #->to see what changes have done and when?

##very dangerous commond ->$ rm -rf .git
$rm -rf .git
#->rm -rf command deletes directory forcefully. It means a file or directory will be deleted anyhow even if it has
read-only permission. To delete a file forcefully, use command: rm -f <file name>

#->these will delete the hidden file  (.git) =>which is traking our project
so will lost all our track i.e we will lost our git repo itself

-------------------------------------
$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
git clone URL-name "name of these file"  #->"name of these file is not necessary=>syntax

##commond
1)$pwd

#this will show pwd=present working diretory->i.e present file path

2)$ls

#this will list out the different fle in our git repo

3)$ cd tensorflow/

#this will change our file-path and take us into respective file-path


--------------------------------------git ignore----------------------------------
###to ignore some file for tracking
#making new file in ours folder
    ->$ touch error.log

#to ignore
$touch .gitignore
